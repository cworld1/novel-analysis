## Contributions

To spend more time coding and less time fiddling with whitespace, this project uses code conventions and styles to encourage consistency. Code with a consistent style is easier (and less error-prone!) to review, maintain, and understand.

### Be consistent

If the style guide is not explicit about a particular situation, the cardinal rule is to **be consistent**. For example, take a look at the surrounding code and follow its lead, or look for similar cases elsewhere in the codebase.
